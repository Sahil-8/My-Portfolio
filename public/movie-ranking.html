<h3>OM Shanti OM</h3>
<p>My favourtie bollywood movie starring SRK and debut actress depika padukone :).</p>
<h3>Gone Girl</h3>
<p>Very traumatising movie. Feel bad for Batman.</p>
<h3>War for The Planet of Apes</h3>
<p>Film that shows us the perspective of apes on being experimented upon and where virus makes them the superior species instead of humans.</p>
